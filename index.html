             <p>Located in Aswan’s Northern Quarry just a few minutes walk from Aswan’s downtown area and the Nubian Museum, the Unfinished Obelisk is a rather bizarre part of Aswan’s heritage. It would have been the largest single standing stone in Egypt weighing a whopping 1,168 tons had it not cracked in the middle during its construction! Visiting it is amongst the most interesting things to do in Aswan as it tells you how much time and effort went into the stonemasonry of the greatest ancient structures in Egypt, and how skilled were those masons who made all these before the invention of modern tools! You can see these very skills and efforts reflected in the rock faces surrounding the Obelisk here.</p>

             <p>Sitting on the bank of Lake Nasser is one of Egypt’s most striking monuments, the twin temples of Abu Simbel. Built by Ramesses II over 3,000 years ago, these temples have stood the test of time.
